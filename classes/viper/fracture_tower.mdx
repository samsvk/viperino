## Why this Lineup?

When entertaing B Main, we often are faced by an opponent holding
from Tower. This lineup completely negates that scenario forcing
the opponent to either push the smoke, or fall back to arcade.

## Benefits:

- Extremely easy to carry out.
- Forces enemies to play unfavorable angles or leave site.
- Easily retrieve orb for post plant.

## Limitations:

- Reduced toxin energy so wall on main can often come down early.
