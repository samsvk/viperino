## Viper Lineup

This advantage to this lineup becomes apparent when your team is
looking to execute "A bomb site" on Breeze. Generally I find
myself combining Sage's wall to gain full control of Tube/Halls
however it is not necessary to be effective but recommended if a
Sage is on your team.

## Breeze Changes

Due to the recent changes we've seen on Breeze this tactic
becomes even more effective as the switch mechanic now has a
cooldown. Previously, players could play on A Stairs and toggle
the switch closed when you opened the door. This has now been
patched and cannot be closed until the door is fully open.
