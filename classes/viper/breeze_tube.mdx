## Why this Lineup?

This advantage to this lineup becomes apparent when your team is
looking to execute "A bomb site". Generally I find myself
combining Sage's wall to gain full control of Tube/Halls however
it is not necessary to be effective but recommended if a Sage is
on your team.

## Benefits:

- Forces enemies to commit tripwires, util and even a player in
  some cases to hold tube.
- Overall Macro/Map Control.
- Catch opponents off guard.
- Allows for late lurk on post plant.

## Limitations:

- Reduced toxin energy so wall on main can often come down early.
- Like any smoke, can be pop flashed easily.
- Hard to do without a lot of practice.

## Breeze Changes

Due to the recent changes we've seen on Breeze this lineup
becomes even more effective as the switch mechanic now has a
cooldown. Previously, players could play on A Stairs and toggle
the switch closed when you opened the door. This has now been
patched and cannot be closed until the door is fully open.
