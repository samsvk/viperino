## Why this Lineup?

This lineup is extremely important when executing A. How many
times have we had our team get shot over the viper wall from
Orange/Bridge. With Chamber becoming the best sentinel in-game,
it becomes more important to close off one-and-done angles and
that's exactly what this lineup achieves.

## Benefits:

- Prevents players from playing Orange and seeing above Viper
  Wall.
- Reduces angles that has to be cleared by your initiator agent.
- Can be used to create space.
- A small one-way on Orange for post plant.

## Limitations:

- Reduced toxin energy so wall on main can often come down early.
- Can be difficult to retrieve your poison cloud.
