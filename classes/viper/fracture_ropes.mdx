## Why this Lineup?

By smoking Ropes, we're allowing our team to fast push sand
overall giving our team potential to crunch site from both Sand
and Main.

## Benefits:

- Allows for instant sand push.
- Can use viper wall to take control of site rather than cutting
  off CT/Ropes.

## Limitations:

- Opponents can sit inside the smoke at the bottom and popflash
  out.
- Leaves a lot of room for opponents to play around.
