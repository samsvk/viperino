## Why this Lineup?

By smoking out Tower's arcade side, we're allowing our teammates
to crunch any opponent who may be playing behind the large box
just under tower. If nobody is close, we're allowing our
teammates to lurk via arcade giving them access to CT and Site.

## Benefits:

- Provides huge lurk potential for the entire team.
- Forces enemies to either drop from tower, or fight players
  coming from main.
- Allows huge access to site from Arcade side.
- Can help pushing CT to create space and map control.

## Limitations:

- Extremely hard to carry out.
- Can permanently lose orb if failed.
