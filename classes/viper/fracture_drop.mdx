## Why this Lineup?

When executing A, as Viper we're often walling across site -
unfortunately, this leaves drop open which is a favorable angle
for opponents to play and we often see chambers playing there
with their TP. By using this lineup we're fully opening all of
site for our teammates to take space by only having to focus on
right side of site.

## Benefits:

- Takes entire site control leaeving only right side to be
  cleared.
- Can be used to help a teammate lurking Dish/Drop.
- Prevents opponents from being able to shoot over viper wall
  with clear vision.

## Limitations:

- Can give info to opponents allowing them to reduce nobody will
  come from dish.
- Opponents can spam through the smoke into main wtih silenced
  weapons such as Phantom.

- Extremely hard to carry out.
