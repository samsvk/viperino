## Why this Lineup?

Although CT is often preferably smoked as generally when taking B
we're looking to take hooka control - we might need an elbow
smoke. Having this lineup; up your sleeve is never bad.

## Benefits:

- Lands flush with Elbow meaning opponents have no opportunity to
  play around the smoke.
- Can be paired with Sage wall for full control of Site.
- Allows Long pushers to face less angles.

## Limitations:

- Has long travel time and requires your team to wait before
  pushing long can leave you exposed from TP/Hooka pushes.
