## Overview:

When entertaing from B Main, we often see opponents holding from
Tower. When using this lineup correctly, we're able to negate
this from happening. We can force the opponent to either push the
smoke leaving them in a 1vX or otherwise having to fallback to
Arcade and play retake.

## Benefits:

- **Forces enemies into unforgiven scenarios**: By using this
  smoke correctly, we're often able to make enemies into doing
  plays they are uncomfortable with.
- **Easy to perform**: This lineup is very easy to learn,
  rememberable and easy to carry out ingame.
- **Easy to retrieve orb**: Once our team has taken control of
  site, we're able to fetch the Orb easily for post plant or to
  smoke off other surrounding areas.
- **Safe lineup**: This lineup is based in attack side spawn,
  meaning it's a safe lineup to carryout.

## Limitations:

- **Reduced Toxin Energy**: As Fracture is a relatively large
  map, we're often using our Viper Wall to cut off Canteen and
  CT/Defender spawn. By using this lineup, we're going to lose
  uptime on our Viper Wall however allows us to take control of
  site more quickly and clear less angles.

## Conclusion:

When entertaing from B Main, we often see opponents holding from
Tower. When using this lineup correctly, we're able to negate
this from happening. We can force the opponent to either push the
smoke leaving them in a 1vX or otherwise having to fallback to
