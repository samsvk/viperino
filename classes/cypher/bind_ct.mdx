## Why this Lineup?

When entertaing from B, we have two options, hooka or long - when
approaching B it's very important either one is smoked, often CT
is preferable as we'd sometimes like to push elbow and take space
to ensure the opponent retake is harder.

## Benefits:

- Extremely easy to carry out.
- Orb is collectable for post plant lineups.
- Can be used to fake a B hit.
- Low travel time.

## Limitations:

- It's often hard to have the orb lodge itself deep into CT,
  which gives the opponents a little room to play inside.
