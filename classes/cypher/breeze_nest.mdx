## Why this Lineup?

The importance of this lineup becomes clear when the enemy team
has a heavy sentinel based team, or your team is struggling to
penetrate site directly. Being able to take control of mid and
split A/B site via mid control is hard to deal with for most
teams.

## Benefits:

- Prevents players from playing Nest a awp/op hotspot.
- Allows lurking potential into nest.
- Can allow teammates to hit B tunnel at the start of the round
  as Nest is controlled.

## Limitations:

- Can be shot from double door at the beginning of the round if
  not held by another teammate.
- Easy to mess up, and can leave a small gap for your opponents
  to capitalise on.
